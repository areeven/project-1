# React Project

### With TypeScript

```
npx create-react-app project-1 --template typescript
```

Initialize my project removing all irrelevant data from the files, created the title more suited for the project.

Next I will start creating my router with:

```
npm i react-router-dom @types/react-router-dom
```

### Setting up my directory structure

- src
  - assets
  - components
  - shared
  - routes
